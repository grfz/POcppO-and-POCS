===============

Plain Old c++ Object and Plain Old C Structure header file builder

Sometimes I need to build headers for some simple objects (or structs).
These programs are for build the skeletons.
Skeletons in .hpp files includes
- simple get-set methods
- constructors ( by properties, by copy, from CSV)
- serializer (from CSV)
- destructor
- a show() method for debug
Skeletons in .h files includes
- simple get-set functions
- constructors ( by properties, by copy, from CSV)
- serializer (from CSV)
- destructor
- a show() function for debug

to compile:
gcc POCS.c -o POCS
g++ POcppO.cpp -o POcppO
(I know: it pops some warnings - just ignore them, they are for char* instead of string class)
USAGE:
POcppO INPUT_FILE_NAME
or
POCS INPUT_FILE_NAME

THAT's all. Hope you enjoy it. 
(sry for my bad english)
